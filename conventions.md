# Coding Conventions

This are some of the rules I want to follow, or I have been using and want to leave register of they.

## Naming

variables: using underscores and lower case always

functions: camel case, first letter lower case

classes: camel case, first letter upper case

constants: all upper case

## Other rules

use only 80 columns

avoid the use of global variables at all cost

no tabs, two spaces for identation

opening bracket in the same line

Comments should resolve why questions, no what question, if dont then remove it

## Languaje Specific

### Javascript

never use var

always use ending semicolon

single quotes every time possible

declare all variables that will be used at begining of scope

promise chain is dead, looks cool, but is hard to mantain
