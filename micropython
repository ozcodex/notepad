## On the Wemos D1 mini (ESP8266 4Mb)

Starting from a fresh board
when connected appears on /dev/ttyUSB0

With python installed and the esptool pip package

Downloaded the firmware from 
https://micropython.org/download/esp8266/

because a lack of permissions I had to add my user to the 
sudo usermod -a -G dialout oz
